        <p>
          The 3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT) programme, a critical part of
          the Renewed Hope agenda, is aimed at building Nigeria’s technical
          talent backbone to power our digital economy and position Nigeria as a
          net talent exporter. The first phase of the programme, executed in
          collaboration with NITDA, will involve multiple stakeholders including
          fellows, training providers, partners and placement organisations.
